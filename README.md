# MyProjects
1) Numerical Methods course project:
In this project, we were given a thereotical problem statement related to the theory taught in class. The problem statement can be found in the report.

2) Heat Transfer course project: This was an open-ended project where we had to take up a practical problem related to heat transfer and find an innovative solution for the same. Our group has solved the problem of thermal hotspots by cooling using sound waves. Details can be found in the report.

3) Transport Phenomena Course project: In this project, we were given a research paper to study and give a review on. The original paper can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3250858. We also posted the presentation on youtube. The link for the same is: https://youtu.be/RotCXe4B5Ic 

4) Data Science Course Project: In this project, we have applied data science techniques to predict IPL scores.

5) Independent OpenFOAM project 1: This was an independent project from an online course on OpenFOAM. See the problem statement inside to know more.

6) OpenFOAM Course Project: This was a case study done using OpenFOAM where some of the results were validated against a research paper while some new cases were simulated and observations were reported. detailed case study can be found here: https://cfd.fossee.in/case-study-project/case-study-run/212 

7) NeuroClone Course project: In this project, our team used Deep learning concepts to make a "Thought controlled human hand". The details and resources of the project can be found here: https://github.com/SiddhiBG/NeuroClone-Team-Inception
   
8) Extraction of CO2 from Flue gas: This was a simulation-based project in which the target was to optimize the solvent used for extraction of CO2 from flue gas via chemical absorption. 

9) Unsee, Invisible Light and Sci-fi Love: 3 Short stories written by me

10) Carbon Disulphide Production: Simulation-based project where the target was copying the actual process and then optimizing it further.

11) Dry Reforming of Methane: This project critically evaluates novel microkinetic and density functional theory models for dry reforming of methane, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

12) Biosensor for Prostate cancer detection: This project developed a novel, cost-effective biosensor for real-time prostate cancer monitoring by carefully selecting polymer, adhesive, and biomolecule components based on extensive literature research.

13) Genomic Analysis of M. Tuberculosis Strains: This project employed whole genome sequencing to analyze the genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis strains, shedding light on their evolutionary relationships and potential implications for disease treatment and prevention.

14) Conceptual Design of TBA plant: This project developed a conceptual design for a tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) plant, optimizing process parameters, equipment, and environmental impact using simulation and theoretical analysis.

15) Hydrogen Hydrates: This project employed molecular simulations to investigate the feasibility of ice as a hydrogen carrier, using Towhee software and a quantum-corrected classical potential.

16) Calibration of Powdered drugs: This project optimized granular simulations of powdered drugs in ROCKY using coarse-graining and Python scripts, developing a faster calibration method.
